Halloween is always my favourite time of the year, because I get to see everyone's
creativity shine, and it's just plain fun.

This year, I went as Shai'hulud, the sandworm from *Dune*. My girlfriend and 
her friends went as the cast of *Challengers*, so we got Zendaya in common.

Turns out, making the costume didn't take long at all. I got a foam torus, 
some toothpicks (didn't need to use all of them, surprisingly), brown tape,
and a roll of felt. Altogether, the stuff was about $25.

I had intended to staple the felt onto the foam torus, but my staples just weren't
large enough. I instead used some toothpicks to nail the felt in place, and trimmed 
them off. To finish off, I taped around the torus to make sure no nails could 
fall apart. 

Oh, and a hammer was used to nail the toothpicks in. It helped to blunt the tips too.

We went to a halloween party hosted at Overeasy by Eatmepoptart, one of my favourite organisations
because their DJs (especially Weelikeme) play music that suits MY tastes... and 
the crowd typically is older, so... you get the picture.

## 2024 and before

I don't think I'll be making backdated posts, so here's an archive of the last few 
halloween costumes!

In 2024, I was a terrorist from COUNTER-STRIKE! Nothing offensive, I swear!
I had everything on hand, even a fake butterfly knife from AliExpress I got a few years back.

The hardest part was taking out each weight plate from my weighted vest.

### 2023

Went as Kuromi, again attended the Eatmepoptart x Overeasy party. I believe
this was my first time at a poptart party.

### 2022

Sisyphus, or a modern take on it? For some weeks I had a papier-mâché rock 
take up a corner in my university dorm room, on my laundry rack to dry, and 
each day I'd just tack on a few layers of newspaper and wait for it to dry.
One must imagine me happy.

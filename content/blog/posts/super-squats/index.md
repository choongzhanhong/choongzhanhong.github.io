TL;DR: started with 90kg squats and ended with 125kg x 15 clean reps (~ 275lbs).
On my second last workout, I got 19 clean reps with 122.5kg (270lbs).
I went from to 80.0kg to 86.3kg.
Focus on your posture, breathing, diet, mental fortitude, and shorts.

## Background

From 16 Dec 2024 to 24 Jan 2025, I ran the 6-week programme Super Squats
by Dr Randall Strossen. This was my 2nd time running super squats,
this time round I decided to incorporate milk into my diet, albeit 
still not GOMAD, but 2 liters a day. The previous run, I wasn't super committed,
but I went from 60kg to 100kg for 20 rep squats.

I had previously run several iterations of Jacked & Tan 2.0 to some success,
and I was getting bored after my 3rd run of J&T back to back. I did try to
lose some weight, but wasn't very successful. Consequently, I was still a little chubby
but lethargic from lack of food. This was a classic "Bulk or cut?" scenario,
but I think there's no point asking myself that. I needed to put in work.
With the festive season coming up, I decided
to regain some of my energy and double down on the eating, as well as cure my boredom
with some good old fashioned hard work.

I moved house in 2025, and decided it'd be a good time to throw away my old, piss-stained (my cat's, I swear!) single-sized mattress.
I thought this would be the perfect time to do a little research on what makes a good mattress,
and meaningfully replace my old mattress.

Just previously, I had been thinking of sleeping on a futon-type thing to save a bit of floor space too.
While it's still tempting, I don't think I'd actually get used to folding it up daily.

I came across a YouTube video on my Twitter feed which I watched in full one weekend afternoon.
He gave some compelling arguments. 

TL;DR, Get a latex mattress, or memory foam if you have to. Absolutely avoid coils.

Another TL;DR:
There are two main types of latex mattresses based on the chemical process used to make them.
The typical one is Dunlop, with Talalay latex being a more complicated and thus expensive process.

The [Talalay process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talalay_process) confers some 
properties to the latex that may be preferred: most say softer, more breathable.
A lot of mattress store websites have an article on the difference[^talalay].

## Findings

In short, my search came up disappointing. Among the companies I searched,
**none*** had Talalay latex. 

Furthermore, many salespeople did not even know
the difference. At one place where I inquired, the sales lady opened her
laptop to find that they were given a document with info on Dunlop vs Talalay,
which she had never needed to read before.

Even though Singapore is situated amongst sprawling rubber plantations in Southeast Asia,
I could not find companies in the area that supplied Talalay latex, not even in Thailand
or Malaysia.

Understandably, the process itself is more expensive, and I don't suppose
there's much demand in the area.

The US stores don't ship to Singapore. If you really wanted to, you could ship them yourself
through a forwarding service. Likewise with the Vitalalay factories in Europe.
This would probably be the option that guarantees the most reliable results.

\* There were some places selling Talalay Latex toppers, or their mattresses
included a thin layer of Talalay Latex. See below.

### Decent local brands if you're okay with Dunlop

A few brands I shortlisted in my find were decent, but mostly have Dunlop latex.
If you don't really find the difference between Talalay and Dunlop to be that big
of a deal, you could just buy one of these here.

- [Heveya](https://www.heveya.sg/), while expensive, is B Corp certified and is fully transparent
about their mattress makeup, which is 100% Dunlop latex, no frills.
I liked their presentation, and they get my vote for their commitment to sustainability,
transparency.

- [Sofzsleep](https://sofzsleep.net/) is the budget option which also offers 100% Dunlop latex mattresses.
They offer many different mattresses, but I can't really tell the difference between
any of them. Maybe it's the thickness? Nonetheless, you can check them out in-store at 
the Mattress Boutique to find out more. Value for money option.

- [Getha's](https://getha.com.sg) mattresses are Dunlop based on their website's info, but they also sell
Talalay pillows, and some of their mattresses reportedly have a layer of Talalay
in-between. Mid-ranged prices here.

- [Dunlopillo](https://dunlopillo.com.sg/), which is probably an industry leader, has this "Talasilver wave"
mattress layer which I assume is based on Talalay. These make up the comfort layer
of some of their products, and the remaining layers are foam or I assume Dunlop latex.
They also sell Talalay latex toppers, in case you only need the topmost/comfort
layer to be Talalay, this is a reliable option too, being an established name.

- [Woosa](https://woosasleep.co) gets a special shoutout in this section. Their mattresses do have latex
on the top layers, otherwise they're filled with foam and some coils. 
They also claim to use a layer of Talalay, although from what I see it's really thin.
I know, because they present their cross-sections in the stores, which is absolutely what
every mattress brand should do for full transparency.
This brand gets my vote because I laid on their mattresses in-store and they were
extremely soft and comfortable.

### The Conclusion

I was hell-bent on getting a Talalay mattress, 
if only just to see what the fuss is about. In the name of science!

In the end, I looked to Taobao, which is probably the best place to look.
I didn't want to concede just yet, and thought maybe I could
actually DIY something inexpensive.

Another poster on the Mattress Underground shared the same difficulty
finding Talalay latex mattresses in Singapore, and even the ones
on Taobao couldn't be truly verified.

Nonetheless, they made the purchase a year ago, and are reportedly satisfied
with the product. They even supplied the name of the store they bought from,
which saved me a bit of comparing around.

The subsequent sections deal with my experience after receiving the mattress.

## Assembling the mattress

### Ordering the parts

I bought a total of three mattress layers off Taobao, all in queen size (150 by 200cm).

The Talalay layer, intended for the topmost layer[^layers] of the mattress,
was 10cm thick and cost about ￥6800.
Supposedly, this was imported from Vitalalay.

The other two layers, I bought Dunlop layers at different "deflection"[^ild].
Each was 7.5cm thick, and I got 85D and 95D at ￥1330 and ￥1700 respectively.

Total costs chalked up to about ￥8200, or S$1465, or US$1146, the majority of which
was the price of the Talalay layer. Oh, and this price was not inclusive of 
shipping fees and import taxes, which were another few hundred.

The mattresses in their entirety arrived about a month after I had initially ordered.

I also got a mattress cover/protector and some bedsheets. There are some considerations here as well.
Without going into too much research, I got an unquilted cover[^quilt] that claimed to be waterproof
(in case my cat pees on my bed again), and I'm opting for [Tencel](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/tencel-fabric-explainer.html)
 bedsheets at the recommendation of a friend.

### Assembly

With the mattresses shipped, it was time to start assembling the layers.

Since I had previously been sleeping on a single bed, I also bought a simple bedframe
to match the queen sized mattress. 

Overall, it didn't take very long, but the mattresses were heavy, or rather unwieldy.
I think I also received extra pillows from the store, which is nice.

### Review



[^talalay]: Dunlopillo has a [blog post](https://dunlopillo.com.sg/blog/what-is-latex-mattress) on latex mattresses.

[^layers]: The layers of a mattress include the comfort layer, which is the topmost, softest one,
and the support layer, which is firmer at the base. In-between, you may find a transition layer.
In general, the mattress goes from soft to firm as you go down. [Some more information](https://sleepopolis.com/guides/mattress-layers-guide/)

[^ild]: When discussing mattress firmness, a measurement called 
[Indentation Load Deflection](https://sleeponlatex.com/blog/what-is-ild)
or ILD is used. Each store's deflection can only really by compared against itself,
so I'm guessing 85D is less firm than 95D.

[^quilt]: I haven't done much research on the differences, but from 
[what I gather](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/16m3trw/diy_mattress_quilted_versus_unquilted_cover/),
the differences include softness and temperature circulation. Quilted covers may be firmer,
less stretchy, but offer better breathability.

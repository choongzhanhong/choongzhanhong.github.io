I moved house in 2025, and decided it'd be a good time to throw away my old, piss-stained (my cat's, I swear!) single-sized mattress.
I thought this would be the perfect time to do a little research on what makes a good mattress,
and meaningfully replace my old mattress.

Just previously, I had been thinking of sleeping on a Futon-type thing to save a bit of floor space too.
While it's still tempting, I don't think I'd actually get used to folding it up daily.

I came across a YouTube video on my Twitter feed which I watched in full one weekend afternoon.
He gave quite some compelling arguments. 

TL;DR, latex is the way, or memory foam if you have to. Absolutely avoid coils.

So, I set off in search of latex mattresses available in Singapore, 
specifically seeing if I could find any of the Talalay kind.

## Findings

In short, my search came up disappointing. Among the companies I searched,
**none*** had Talalay latex. 

Furthermore, many salespeople did not even know
the difference. At one place where I inquired, the sales lady opened her
laptop to find that they were given a document with info on Dunlop vs Talalay,
which she had never needed to read before.

Even though Singapore is situated amongst sprawling rubber plantations in Southeast Asia,
few companies in the area, even some Thai and Malaysian ones, supply
Talalay latex.

Understandably, the process itself is more expensive, and I don't suppose
there's much demand in the area.

The US stores don't ship to Singapore. If you really wanted to, you could ship them yourself
through a forwarding service. Likewise with the Vitalalay factories in Europe.
This would probably be the option that guarantees the most reliable results.

*\*There were some places selling Talalay Latex toppers, or their mattresses
included a thin layer of Talalay Latex. See below.*

### Decent local brands if you're okay with Dunlop

A few brands I shortlisted in my find were decent, but mostly have Dunlop latex.
If you don't really find the difference between Talalay and Dunlop to be that big
of a deal, you could just buy one of these here.

- Heveya, while expensive, is B Corp certified and is fully transparent
about their mattress makeup, which is 100% Dunlop latex, no frills.
I liked their presentation, and they get my vote for their commitment to sustainability,
transparency.

- Sofzsleep is the budget option which also offers 100% Dunlop latex mattresses.
They offer many different mattresses, but I can't really tell the difference between
any of them. Maybe it's the thickness? Nonetheless, you can check them out in-store at 
the Mattress Boutique to find out more. Value for money option.

- Getha's mattresses are Dunlop based on their website's info, but they also sell
Talalay pillows, and some of their mattresses reportedly have a layer of Talalay
in-between. Mid-ranged prices here.

- Dunlopillo, which is probably an industry leader, has this "Talasilver wave"
mattress layer which I assume is based on Talalay. These make up the comfort layer
of some of their products, and the remaining layers are foam or I assume Dunlop latex.
They also sell Talalay latex toppers, in case you only need the topmost/comfort
layer to be Talalay, this is a reliable option too, being an established name.

- Woosa gets a special shoutout in this section. Their mattresses do have latex
on the top layers, otherwise they're filled with foam and some coils. 
They also claim to use a layer of Talalay, although from what I see it's really thin.
I know, because they present their cross-sections in the stores, which is absolutely what
every mattress brand should do for full transparency.
This brand gets my vote because I lay on their mattresses in-store and they were
extremely soft and comfortable.

### The Conclusion

I was hell-bent on getting a Talalay mattress, if not just to compare
it to Dunlop and see what the fuss is about. In the name of science!

In the end, I looked to Taobao, which is probably the best place to look.
I didn't want to concede just yet, and thought maybe I could
actually DIY something inexpensive.


Another poster on the Mattress Underground shared the same difficulty
finding Talalay latex mattresses in Singapore, and even the ones
on Taobao couldn't be truly verified.

Nonetheless, they made the purchase a year ago, and are reportedly satisfied
with the product. They even supplied the name of the store they bought from,
which saved me a bit of comparing around.

The subsequent sections deal with my experience after receiving the mattress.

I want to write about this because Singapore is hot
(it is), and our offices and universities are too cold, and
I see a lot of portable fans being used around me and I can't stand it,
and I think we're really giving up the opportunity to temper ourselves
to the climate.

In general, technology solves some problems, but a lot of them
have already been solved by nature, and these two solutions find themselves at
odds with each other. Like if a community of blobfish[^blob]
decided that the deep sea environment was far too pressurised, and
depressurised their surroundings. They'd all be blobs!

## The Sun

![A snippet of the sun tarot card](./sun.jpg)

Here in Singapore, we have eternally sunny and humid weather, with the occasional
tropical monsoon. It gets hot, people get sweaty.

Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore, was known to have pushed
heavily for the installation of air conditioning (AC) throughout the country.

> Air conditioning was a most important invention for us, 
> perhaps one of the signal inventions of history. 
> It changed the nature of civilization by making development possible in the tropics.

It's true. I simply don't think I can focus as well if I'm sweating, thighs sticking
to pleather seat, arms leaving stains on the table. Been there.

I worked best in university in my climate-controlled enclosure (study rooms),
which were freezing cold, but I wonder if that's just too much.
Everyone brought jackets, which was a sign that the temperature
overshot the ideal equilibrium.

I think it's great that AC, and refrigeration in general has become
so commonplace. Not too long ago, the lack of such technologies heavily
shaped human culture.

What I want to hazard against is the proliferation of the idea that modern life
(in Singapore) is just moving from one air-conditioned place to another, trying 
to minimize time exposed to the outside world. As much as sun damage is a real threat,
there are benefits to getting some fresh air and sunlight.

If you spend like 20 hours of the day in an air conditioned environment,
I do believe this disrupts your body's natural heat acclimatisation.
Do this over the course of a lifetime and you're a fish out of water in your own country,
hypothalamusically speaking.

The laws of physics were once more difficult to bend.
Humans, of course, adapted along these laws,
like figuring out fermentation, canning, pickling, etc. to keep food from spoiling.
In every bit of culture there is a reflection of the struggle and success.

I do, however, think that a lot of us have been coddled by technology to the point 
of no return; we don't know how to live in tandem with nature anymore. 
At least, that's my view in the context of Singapore.

### Definitions

If you continue reading, I'd like to make a note on the title of this article.
Tempering isn't really the closest word to some of what I describe, but it stuck.

There is, I guess, an etymological relationship to temperature, specifically heat.
Materials are typically tempered with heat to increase their strength.
I'd like to apply this concept to the heat of Singapore and what it does for our
collective approach to surviving in nature. In other words, *tahan*-ing[^tahan].

What I really mean is acclimatising, but in choosing the word "Tempering", I'm
making a nod at concepts of virtue.

Anyway, I don't think I'm any more virtuous than you just because I
sleep with just the fan, but I do suspect my habits have made
me a little more resistant to the heat in Singapore.

Infrastructure-wise, there might be room for bettter design to incorporate the 
elements rather than resist them.

### Ventilation 

One of my favourite things I've ever learned from a friend (studying architecture)
was the concept of cross ventilation.
I could never look at things the same way ever again, 
and I'm only mildly exaggerating.

I first started noticing portable fans heavily being used in South Korea during the summer.
Likewise, back in Singapore. It's hard not to notice when they emit a high-pitched
hissing when they operate which is just barely under my threshold of intolerability.

Fans are great, often more effective than air conditioning,
I just wish 

![image of a room with a brickwork wall with ventilation](./ventilation.jpg)

[Check out this article I found.](https://www.archdaily.com/1008994/balancing-function-and-aesthetics-incorporating-natural-light-and-ventilation-in-facades)

Architecture that integrates ventilation will often also integrate natural sunlight,
which gets another thumbs-up in my book, because I think we overuse LEDs,
and I'll to that in the next section.

Ventilation works because it speeds up evaporation of sweat, which is how the 
body loses heat. That brings me to the next point.

### Evaporation

Every so often, Singaporeans online bring up the "showering in the morning" discourse,
which is one of those topics where seemingly neither side of the argument will ever 
see eye to eye.

I of course think you should shower in the morning, especially in this type of 
climate and if you have a long day ahead (say, if you're going to work).

It also helps you keep cool, so maybe more Singaporeans would feel less heat
if they also showered in the morning.

## The Moon

![A snippet of the moon tarot card](./moon.jpg)

A few times I've sailed around Indonesian waters, around the Singapore strait.
Out in the sea, darkness permeates
everything at night. It's scary just how little you can see.

Singapore, however, is quite visible from afar. A brownish cloud of light lingers
above the island-nation from nautical miles away.

It's how we know we're on the right track,
which is increasingly difficult because (forget that GPS exists for a second)
lights everywhere have blotted out most of the celestial figures sailors
use to fix their position.

I don't enjoy Singapore, or anywhere's obsession with lighting. 
Many new places now are bloody bright with LEDs, especially the newly-renovated
coffeeshops I frequent.

I think it takes a certain restraint to use minimal lighting, and to use it well,
to create a comfortable atmosphere. A lot of it rests on clever manipulation of
natural sunlight, like the article I linked above.

I love floor-to-ceiling windows for that reason. It fills your room with light,
and it's often miles brighter and pleasant than sterile white fluorescence.

### Circadian rhythm

I'm going to make a bold statement here: If you're constantly tired, it's because you
aren't sleeping properly, and you aren't sleeping right because lights are messing with your
sleep schedule.

Singapore's timezone is *wrong*. Our sun comes up too late in the morning (for most
other places, it's 6am). If you have to get up early to get to work or school, which
most do, that's a whole hour of difference.

Another thing: It doesn't help that electric lights keep us awake and productive longer,
and all the blue light we get from our screens aren't helping either.

It'll be difficult to change the time zone, but the least we can do is reduce the 
amount of light we get at night. I've heard that it genuinely helps to just lie in
bed with the lights off even if you're not sleepy but should sleep; it'll do you 
a lot more good than using your phone.

## The Hermit

![A snippet of the hermit tarot card](./hermit.jpg)

I think a sign of my ageing has been me literally watering down my sweet drinks,
quite literally doing as the figure in the tarot card does.

At the end of this post, I'd like to say that I don't think the way I live is
superior, but it's worthwhile, I believe, to take full advantage of nature
while we still can, I suppose. Be it human nature or mother nature.

Oh, and use sunscreen.

[^blob]: They only look like that because they were photographed in a highly 
depressurized environment (relative to their natural one). 
It's like Brits suffering heatstrokes in 25°C weather, which is an ideal
air-conditioned/room temperature in Singapore.

[^tahan]: Malay word meaning to resist or endure.

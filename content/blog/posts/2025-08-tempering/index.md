![Tarot card, Temperance](./temperance.jpg)

This has been on my mind a while, and so I'd like to pen it down.

Here in Singapore, we have eternally sunny and humid weather, with the occasional
tropical monsoon.

Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore, was known to have pushed
heavily for the installation of air conditioning (AC) throughout the country.

> Air conditioning was a most important invention for us, 
> perhaps one of the signal inventions of history. 
> It changed the nature of civilization by making development possible in the tropics.

It's true. I simply don't think I can focus as well if I'm sweating, thighs sticking
to pleather seat, arms leaving stains on the table.

I think it's great that AC, and refrigeration in general has become
so commonplace. Not too long ago, the lack of such technologies heavily
shaped human culture, especially when it comes to food; fermentation, pickling,
smoking, etc. were all means to keeping food long-term.

However, I feel we're reaching a point of no return, where even air-conditioning 
is becoming insufficient to stave off the heat, which will only get hotter.

### Those damn Jisulife fans 

I first started noticing portable fans heavily being used in South Korea during the summer.
Likewise, back in Singapore. It's hard not to notice when they emit a high-pitched
hissing when they operate.

Have we lost the plot? Please excuse my doomerism, but I don't think the solution
to increasing ambient temperatures is supplementing additional measures.

In fact, I think we've gone too long as an AC-loving people, and as a result,
have lost the natural acclimatising effects of staying in a tropical climate.

We're like fish out of water in our own country. How's that?

## Definitions

If you continue reading, I'd like to make a note on the title of this article.
Tempering isn't really the closest word to what I'm describing, but it stuck.

What I really mean is acclimatising, but in choosing the word "Tempering", I'm
making a nod at many concepts.

Firstly, there is an etymological relationship to temperature, specifically heat.
Materials are typically tempered with heat to increase their strength.
I'd like to apply this concept to the heat of Singapore and what it does for our
collective approach to temperature.

Secondly, I enjoy the mysticism of tarot cards, and would like to allude to
the 14th card of the major arcana, Temperance, which is a virtue that 
simply means moderation or restraint. Again, very relevant concepts in this writing.

## Where else?

With all the talk about temperature, I'd also like to extend the concept to other
facets of nature that we try to exert our control over.

### XIX The Sun

Excuse me for the tarot reference again.

A few times I've sailed around Indonesian waters. Out in the sea, darkness permeates
everything at night. It's scary just how little you can see.

Singapore, however, is quite visible from afar. It's how we know we're on the right track,
which is increasingly difficult because (forget that GPS exists for a second)
lights everywhere have blotted out most of the celestial figures sailors
use to fix their position.

I don't enjoy Singapore, or anywhere's obsession with lighting. 
Many new places now are bloody bright with LEDs, especially the newly-renovated
coffeeshops I frequent.

## Drinks

Finally, as I began writing this, I decided to read Cherian George's 
[Air Conditioned Nation](https://www.airconditionednation.com/), in hopes
that I'm not just repeating points said-before as old as I am.

I suggest you do too, it's a nice book. While this post of mine is less political
commentary and more "old (26-year-old) man yells at cloud", some things are 
similar.

We're too comfortable. We have *too many comforts.*
It'll bite us in the back if we're not careful.

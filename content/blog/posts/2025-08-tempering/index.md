I want to write about this because Singapore is hot
(it is), and our offices and universities are too cold, and
I see a lot of portable fans being used around me and I can't stand it,
and I think we're really giving up the opportunity to temper ourselves
to the climate.

## The Sun

![A snippet of the sun tarot card](./sun.jpg)

Here in Singapore, we have eternally sunny and humid weather, with the occasional
tropical monsoon. It gets hot, people get sweaty.

Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore, was known to have pushed
heavily for the installation of air conditioning (AC) throughout the country.

> Air conditioning was a most important invention for us, 
> perhaps one of the signal inventions of history. 
> It changed the nature of civilization by making development possible in the tropics.

It's true. I simply don't think I can focus as well if I'm sweating, thighs sticking
to pleather seat, arms leaving stains on the table. Been there.

I worked best in university in my climate-controlled enclosure (study rooms),
which were freezing cold and I always wondered just how much impact it had on the weather.

I think it's great that AC, and refrigeration in general has become
so commonplace. Not too long ago, the lack of such technologies heavily
shaped human culture.

The laws of physics used to be stricter laws, where we had to find ways to abide by them,
like figuring out fermentation, canning, pickling, etc. to keep food from spoiling.

Point is, civilisation used to work alongside nature. I don't think it's anything
new to say that humans have disrupted this balance.

I do, however, think that a lot of us have been coddled by technology to the point 
of no return; we don't know how to live in tandem with nature anymore. 
At least, that's my view in the context of Singapore.

### Definitions

If you continue reading, I'd like to make a note on the title of this article.
Tempering isn't really the closest word to some of what I describe, but it stuck.

There is, I guess, an etymological relationship to temperature, specifically heat.
Materials are typically tempered with heat to increase their strength.
I'd like to apply this concept to the heat of Singapore and what it does for our
collective approach to surviving in nature.

What I really mean is acclimatising, but in choosing the word "Tempering", I'm
making a nod at concepts of virtue.

Anyway, I don't think I'm any more virtuous than you just because I
sleep with just the fan, but I do suspect my habits have made
me a little more resistant to the heat in Singapore.

### Those damn Jisulife fans 

I first started noticing portable fans heavily being used in South Korea during the summer.
Likewise, back in Singapore. It's hard not to notice when they emit a high-pitched
hissing when they operate which is just barely under my threshold of intolerability.

Fans are great, often more effective than air conditioning,
but I think we've gone too long as an AC-loving people, and as a result,
have lost the natural acclimatising effects of staying in a tropical climate.

If you spend like 20 hours of the day in an air conditioned environment,
I do believe this disrupts your body's natural heat acclimatisation.

### Do we use too much AC?

I recently went to read a bit of Cherian George's [Air Conditioned Nation](https://www.airconditionednation.com/).
A lot of the things I could be saying here are better said by him, so I don't claim
to be making any profound statements, mostly focusing on the physical aspects of temperature.

### Cross Ventilation and Fans

Some architect friend told me about this.

[Check out this article I found.](https://www.archdaily.com/1008994/balancing-function-and-aesthetics-incorporating-natural-light-and-ventilation-in-facades)

Architecture that integrates ventilation will often also integrate natural sunlight,
which gets another thumbs-up in my book, because I think we overuse LEDs,
and I'll to that in the next section.

### Showering

Every so often, Singaporeans online bring up the "showering in the morning" discourse,
which is one of those topics where seemingly neither side of the argument will ever 
see eye to eye.

I of course think you should shower in the morning, especially in this type of 
climate and if you have a long day ahead (say, if you're going to work).

It also helps you keep cool, so maybe more Singaporeans would feel less heat
if they also showered in the morning.

## The Moon

![A snippet of the moon tarot card](./moon.jpg)

A few times I've sailed around Indonesian waters, around the Singapore strait.
Out in the sea, darkness permeates
everything at night. It's scary just how little you can see.

Singapore, however, is quite visible from afar. A brownish cloud of light lingers
above the island-nation from nautical miles away.

It's how we know we're on the right track,
which is increasingly difficult because (forget that GPS exists for a second)
lights everywhere have blotted out most of the celestial figures sailors
use to fix their position.

I don't enjoy Singapore, or anywhere's obsession with lighting. 
Many new places now are bloody bright with LEDs, especially the newly-renovated
coffeeshops I frequent.

I think it takes a certain restraint to use minimal lighting, and to use it well,
to create a comfortable atmosphere. A lot of it rests on clever manipulation of
natural sunlight, like the article I linked above.

I love floor-to-ceiling windows for that reason. It fills your room with light,
and it's often miles brighter and pleasant than sterile white fluorescence.

### Circadian rhythm

I'm going to make a bold statement here: If you're constantly tired, it's because you
aren't sleeping properly, and you aren't sleeping right because lights are messing with your
sleep schedule.

Singapore's timezone is *wrong*. Our sun comes up too late in the morning (for most
other places, it's 6am). If you have to get up early to get to work or school, which
most do, that's a whole hour of difference.

Another thing: It doesn't help that electric lights keep us awake and productive longer,
and all the blue light we get from our screens aren't helping either.

It'll be difficult to change the time zone, but the least we can do is reduce the 
amount of light we get at night. I've heard that it genuinely helps to just lie in
bed with the lights off even if you're not sleepy but should sleep; it'll do you 
a lot more good than using your phone.

## The Hermit

I think a sign of my ageing has been me literally watering down my sweet drinks,
quite literally doing as the figure in the tarot card does.

At the end of this post, I'd like to say that I don't think the way I live is
superior, but it's worthwhile, I believe, to take full advantage of nature
while we still can, I suppose. Be it human nature or mother nature.

Oh, and use sunscreen.

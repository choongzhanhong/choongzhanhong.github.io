This has been on my mind a while, and so I'd like to pen it down.

Here in Singapore, we have eternally sunny and humid weather, with the occasional
tropical monsoon.

Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore, was known to have pushed
heavily for the installation of air conditioning (AC) throughout the country.

> Air conditioning was a most important invention for us, 
> perhaps one of the signal inventions of history. 
> It changed the nature of civilization by making development possible in the tropics.

## Tempering Oneself

If you continue reading, I'd like to make a note on the title of this article.
Tempering isn't really the closest word to what I'm describing, but it stuck.

What I really mean is acclimatising, but in choosing the word "Tempering", I'm
making a nod at many concepts.

Firstly, there is an etymological relationship to temperature, specifically heat.
Materials are typically tempered with heat to increase their strength.
I'd like to apply this concept to the heat of Singapore and what it does for our
collective approach to temperature.

Secondly, I enjoy the mysticism of tarot cards, and would like to allude to
the 14th card of the major arcana, Temperance, which simply means moderation or restraint.
Again, very relevant concepts in this writing.

## Living in Nature

With all the talk about temperature, I'd also like to extend the concept to other
facets of nature that we try to exert our control over.

Light, especially.

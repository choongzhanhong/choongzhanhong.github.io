I moved house in 2025, and decided it'd be a good time to throw away my old, piss-stained (my cat's, I swear!)
single mattress.
I thought this would be the perfect time to do a little research on what makes a good mattress.
Just previously, I had been thinking of sleeping on a Futon-type thing to save a bit of floor space too.

I came across a YouTube video on my Twitter feed which I watched in full one weekend afternoon.
He gave quite some compelling arguments. TL;DR, buy Latex mattresses.

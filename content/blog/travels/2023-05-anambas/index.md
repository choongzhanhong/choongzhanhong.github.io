In the summer of 2023, after the completion of another semester of university,
I happened to see an advertisement for a school-subsidised trip to sail
on a wooden schooner off to the Anambas Regency, a cluster of islands in Indonesian territory.

I claim to love the sea, but had never sailed in this manner before.
This was the chance to earn my sea legs.

It turned out to be one of the more significant experiences of my life!
Have a look at some of the photos of beautiful nature and the open sea.

I went to Japan with my colleagues in September, primarily to attend Tokyo Game Show (TGS) on the 25–26th.
We also spent some extra days enjoying Osaka and Tokyo,
taking paid leave and financing the trip out of our own pockets.

The last time I visited Japan in 2020, I went solo, which was great for taking
long walks, but not so much for shared experiences, which I think I maximised on this trip.

Too much, in fact. Some lesser-known areas (to me) were visited, such as Amanohashidate
and Oyama for a firework festival. Oh, and I'll talk about TGS as well.
I'll try to focus on these parts of the trip, since the rest of Japan is pretty well known.

## Osaka

The first half of our trip was spend in Osaka, and naturally parts in Kyoto.

### Amanohashidate 天橋立

Being in the Kansai region, the main hubs of activity tend to be Osaka and Kyoto.



## Itinerary

### Costs

Most of our costs were shared within the large group, so I can't say these prices
will be representative of most trips, least of all the 12-man AirBnB.

Flights
- $308 SIN -> KIX via Peach MM774 + 1 checked luggage
- $257 NRT -> SIN via Air Japan NQ3 (which got CANCELLED on the morning of...)
- $434 NRT -> SIN via Zipair ZG53 (Hoping insurance will cover)
- $639 Total accommodations (average $60 a night)

Total was about $3k+, which I came to learn was "not that bad", but it still stung
to me, who apparently hasn't had a longer trip in a while.

I went to Japan with my colleagues in September, primarily to attend Tokyo Game Show (TGS) on the 25–26th.
We also spent some extra days enjoying Osaka and Tokyo,
taking paid leave and financing the trip out of our own pockets.

The last time I visited Japan in 2020, I went solo, which was great for taking
long walks, but not so much for shared experiences, which I think I maximised on this trip.

Too much, in fact. Some lesser-known areas (to me) were visited, such as Amanohashidate
and Oyama for a firework festival. Oh, and I'll talk about TGS as well.

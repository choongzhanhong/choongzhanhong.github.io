Over the lunar new year holidays in 2025, I went to Vietnam for a week; with my family for the first 4
 days, and solo the last 3 days. 
 I'd like to take some time to reflect on the trip, and hope this serves as useful information.

 ## Itinerary
 
I planned loosely around the main thing I wanted to do: Conquer mount Fansipan in Sa Pa. 
Everything else, I just made sure I was hitting certain locations like the old quarters, 
but no specific spots for food and shopping.

### With family
- Day 1: Exploring Hanoi Old Quarters, night train to Sa Pa
- Day 2: Exploring Sa Pa Centre
- Day 3: Go up Fansipan, night train to Hanoi
- Day 4: Exploring Hanoi West Lake and Old Quarters
### Solo 
- Day 5: Exploring Ba Dinh area, Old Quarters
- Day 6: Day trip to Ninh Binh
- Day 7: Lunch with Hanoi friend before flight

Itinerary-wise, this was rather tight. A night train meant we had a whole day to explore the area,
 which was plenty of time, all the while saving on a night's worth of hotel fees. 
 However, it also meant we had no hotel room to rest or refresh ourselves. 
 In particular, having to wait for the train to depart at night, and having hotel check-ins in the afternoon meant no proper showers for a long period. 
 
 I made a mistake planning a train back to Hanoi the night of my Fansipan hike, 
 which meant I went a day without showering after my hike. 
 Thankfully, the weather was frigid with strong winds, especially at the summit.
 I didn't stink and didn't sweat.

Since we arrived during the lunar new year, or Tết, many shops were closed on the first few days.
 It was a completely different Hanoi when we first touched down versus the last few days
 (Tết celebrations ended on Monday, 3 Feb, and most businesses resumed then).

 I expected we would see a unique side of Vietnam with Tết celebrations, 
 but we didn't encounter much. What we did see were loads of families dressed to the nines
 crowding the busy streets, and that was a sight to behold. Everybody looked so good.
 Perhaps I could have planned better to seek out festivities, 
 but I wouldn't say it's worth going during this specific period as shops are closed.

## Climbing Fansipan
 
On to the main event! I climbed Fansipan in a day, which means I started early in the morning (around 7?) and reached the summit at noon.

Despite its relatively low elevation of ~3k meters, it's quite steep.
There are no tricky parts, just high steps, and each step took the wind out of me.
For my Hmong guide, it was a regular weekday, and I got *Hmogged* by him.

> We do this not because it is easy, but because we thought it would be easy.

It was only later when I told my friends about the trip that I realised how much of a feat it was to climb it in one day, let alone by noon. Most climbs up Fansipan take 2D1N. 

There are two rest stops along the trail, where you have lunch on the first and sleep in the second, resuming the climb the next day. 
For me, I skipped the first rest stop and had lunch at the second. This took about 3-4 hours, and the after lunch another 2-3 hours.

    I needed to eat and rest here, oh, sweet salvation.

Once you reach the top (but not the summit), you'll be at the base of a very large temple, where the people come exiting out of the cable cars. There are steep stone stairs up to the summit, which took another half an hour. I was buffeted by strong, icy winds at the top, and it was too cloudy for a nice photograph. Oh well, I made it, and tasted victory, which tasted like... Chocolate, actually. 

### Getting There

Information online is conflicting. Climbing Fansipan is no joke, and you need to have a guide. The route was rather straightforward, but the guide will help sort out your permit and rest stops along the way. 

Also, because of the cable cars, you hardly see anyone on the trail. I ran into only a handful of people along the way. It's no good to be alone on a mountain. 

I was recommended Sapa Trekking Hiking Tours by my Vietnamese friend and they delivered. Fast to respond, English speaking, and they settle everything you need, also including taxi before and after the hike, and cable car/funicular tickets if needed. 

I requested for them for my family to join me at the peak, and I wasn't going to climb down on foot, so I also got myself the tickets.

Altogether, I paid about $230 USD, which would have been cheaper (per pax) if I had gone with a group. $90 for 1 pax hike, $35 x 3 for cable car, $7.50 x 3 for the funicular, and $5 x 2 for the transportation.

**On that note,** if you're just taking the cable car up, you will get there via the funicular
from Sun Plaza at Sapa town center.

### Supplies

Hanoi has several winterwear shops of questionable authenticity. Fortunate for me, because I desperately needed more coverage than had I packed. Even Hanoi was unbearably cold for my ever-loving tropical sunshine self, so Fansipan would have killed me. I wore three layers — of which two were purchased from Hanoi — during the hike and it still wasn't enough to stave off the cold completely, which was intensified by the dampness.

I did have a hearty breakfast before departing, but I should have brought more snacks for energy. I was very much winded up until we reached the 2nd rest stop at 10am, where the guide prepared instant noodles with egg, and gave me fruits, Oreas, and soy milk as well. Having warm food when I was already half freezing to death kept me going for the last leg of the climb.

## Experiences and Recommendations
 
Here are the more generic experiences aside from the mountain.
 
### Hanoi
 
### Sapa Town

### Ninh Binh

I had a bit of extra time in Hanoi, so I decided to book a day trip to either Ninh Binh or Ha Long Bay. I chose Ninh Binh, and I took on my hotel's services of arranging a trip, which led to me joining a tour group. Given that I requested this on short notice, I was quite happy with the services, although I was a little bored with Ninh Binh.

A bus picked me up at my hotel at 7AM, and we headed out first to Hoa Lu Ancient Capital. This was followed by some cycling around the area before we stopped for a buffet lunch at one of the hotels/homestays in the area. I quite enjoyed the cycling, for the weather was perfect and I liked the peaceful scenery, something different from Hanoi. The latter half of the day, we went to the river, and then the Lying Dragon Mountain.

The river trip was BORING. I spent 1.5h on the boat being ferried and after a while, I was getting cold... At the end of the trip, they ask you for tips.

At this point, I had genuinely ran out of cash on hand, so I sheepishly tipped the boater
barely enough for a meal, which was not well-received.

### Others
#### Trains
There are two options for night trains: King and Chapa Express. We took King from Hanoi to Lao Cai, and Chapa on the way back. Chapa is just better in my opinion. First of all, there are charging ports in the cabins. Chapa also had an on-train menu, and we got some beers and snacks from the trolley. You can even rest at the Chapa lounge at Lao Cai station. They were both clean and comfortable. As I've mentioned, these sleeper trains save you a night of hotel's stay, but you will be out of a place to freshen up unless you have early check-in, so do take note.

#### Clothing
I don't know if it was because of Tết or if uncles just have that much drip, but just about every uncle I saw was slaying the house down in their suits. Vietnam is known for some of its tailors, whose services are pretty fast and affordable. I hadn't planned to tailor a suit, but I feel I should have. All those uncles must have gotten their suits locally, and they were walking advertisements to the quality of suits in Hanoi to me.

#### This weird guy
I also met this weird guy at my hotel. He approached me at breakfast and spoke in an unsure, muffled manner, but I could tell he was from China and so I tried to speak Mandarin to him. Even then, he didn't speak very clearly. All I could gather was that he was there for parties... Maybe a sex tourist? Hahah. I never really got a proper answer. He did weird out the restaurant staff who afterwards asked me what his deal was. 
 
Hanoi's great. As a Banh Mi lover, I was disappointed, but apparently they're more known for their Bun Cha, with HCMC being the place to go if I want to explore good Banh Mi. I suppose it's a great stop for clothes and food. As my first foray into Vietnamese culture, it was a pleasant one. 

P.S. With the Vietnamese language having Chinese influences, I thought about how the written language is basically permanently in Hanyu Pinyin.

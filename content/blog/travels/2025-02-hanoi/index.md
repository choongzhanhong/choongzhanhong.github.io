Over the lunar new year holidays in 2025, I went to Vietnam for a week; with my family for the first 4
 days, and solo the last 3 days. 
 I'd like to take some time to reflect on the trip, and hope this serves as useful information.

 ## Itinerary
 
I planned loosely around the main thing I wanted to do: Conquer mount Fansipan in Sa Pa. 
Everything else, I just made sure I was hitting certain locations like the old quarters, 
but no specific spots for food and shopping.

### With family
- Day 1: Exploring Hanoi Old Quarters, night train to Sa Pa
- Day 2: Exploring Sa Pa Centre
- Day 3: Go up Fansipan, night train to Hanoi
- Day 4: Exploring Hanoi West Lake and Old Quarters
### Solo 
- Day 5: Exploring Ba Dinh area, Old Quarters
- Day 6: Day trip to Ninh Binh
- Day 7: Lunch with Hanoi friend before flight

Itinerary-wise, this was rather tight. A night train meant we had a whole day to explore the area,
 which was plenty of time, all the while saving on a night's worth of hotel fees. 
 However, it also meant we had no hotel room to rest or refresh ourselves. 
 In particular, having to wait for the train to depart at night, and having hotel check-ins in the afternoon meant no proper showers for a long period. 
 
 I made a mistake planning a train back to Hanoi the night of my Fansipan hike, 
 which meant I went a day without showering after my hike. 
 Thankfully, the weather was frigid with strong winds, especially at the summit.
 I didn't stink and didn't sweat.

Since we arrived during the lunar new year, or Tết, many shops were closed on the first few days.
 It was a completely different Hanoi when we first touched down versus the last few days
 (Tết celebrations ended on Monday, 3 Feb, and most businesses resumed then).

 I expected we would see a unique side of Vietnam with Tết celebrations, 
 but we didn't encounter much. What we did see were loads of families dressed to the nines
 crowding the busy streets, and that was a sight to behold. Everybody looked so good.
 Perhaps I could have planned better to seek out festivities, 
 but I wouldn't say it's worth going during this specific period as shops are closed.

 ## Climbing Fansipan
 
  On to the main event! I climbed Fansipan in a day, which means I started early in the morning (around 7?) and reached the summit at noon. Despite its relatively low elevation of ~3k meters, it's extremely steep. Each step took the wind out of me. For my Hmong guide, it was a regular weekday. I thought it would be easy, but I got Hmogged by him.

> We do this not because it is easy, but because we thought it would be easy.

It was only later when I told my friends about the trip that I realised how much of a feat it was to climb it in one day, let alone by noon. Most climbs up Fansipan take 2D1N. There are two rest stops along the trail, where you have lunch on the first and sleep in the second, resuming the climb the next day. For me, I skipped the first rest stop and had lunch at the second. This took about 3-4 hours, and the remaining climb another 2-3 hours.

Once you reach the top (but not the summit), you'll be at the base of a very large temple, where the people come exiting out of the cable cars. There are steep stone stairs up to the summit, which are another half an hour. I was buffeted by strong, icy winds at the top, and it was too cloudy for a nice photograph. Oh well, I made it, and tasted victory, which tasted like... Chocolate, actually. 

 ### Guide

Information online is conflicting. Climbing Fansipan is no joke, and you need to have a guide. The route was rather straightforward, but the guide will help sort out your permit and rest stops along the way. Also, because of the cable cars, you hardly see anyone on the trail. I ran into only a handful of people along the way. It's no good to be alone on a mountain. I was recommended Sapa Trekking Hiking Tours by my Vietnamese friend and they delivered. Fast to respond, English speaking, and they settle everything you need, also including taxi before and after the hike, and cable car/funicular tickets if needed. I requested for them for my family to join me at the peak, and I wasn't going to climb down on foot, so I also got myself the tickets.

Altogether, I paid about $230 USD, which would have been cheaper (per pax) if I had gone with a group. $90 for 1 pax hike, $35 x 3 for cable car, $7.5 x 3 for the funicular, and $5 x 2 for the transportation.

### Supplies

Hanoi has several winterwear shops of questionable authenticity. Fortunate for me, because I desperately needed more coverage than had I packed. Even Hanoi was unbearably cold for my ever-loving tropical sunshine self, so Fansipan would have killed me. I wore three layers — of which two were purchased from Hanoi — during the hike and it still wasn't enough to stave off the cold completely, which was intensified by the dampness.

I did have a hearty breakfast before departing, but I should have brought more snacks for energy. I was very much winded up until we reached the 2nd rest stop at 10am, where the guide prepared instant noodles with egg, and gave me fruits, Oreas, and soy milk as well. Having warm food when I was already half freezing to death kept me going for the last leg of the climb. 

 Hanoi's great. As a Banh Mi lover, I was disappointed, but apparently they're more known for their Bun Cha, with HCMC being the place to go if I want to explore good Banh Mi. I suppose it's a great stop for clothes and food. As my first foray into Vietnamese culture, it was a pleasant one. 
 
 P.S. With the Vietnamese language having Chinese influences, I thought about how the written language is basically permanently in Hanyu Pinyin.

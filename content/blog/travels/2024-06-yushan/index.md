## Taiwan!

10 â€“ 18 June 2024.

### At the hut

The mountain shack is a place to rest before heading out
again for the summit.

By the time we got there, we were soaked.
There are places to hang our equipment to dry, though
the humidity and temperature made it difficult to
get fully dry. We still managed to an acceptable level, though!

You could help yourself to heaping portions of soup and 
braised meat rice, which warmed us up.

### The summit



## Taipei

I'm not gonna lie, it was quite boring to me.
I did enjoy the food, gashapon machines, and the nightly Taiwan Beer inbibing,
but apart from that, there wasn't anything special to me.

I really enjoyed the architecture style of the country
parts of Taiwan. Very old school, and full of soul.
Taiwan Beer hits the spot for me, and the street food
were perfect accompaniments.

## Yilan

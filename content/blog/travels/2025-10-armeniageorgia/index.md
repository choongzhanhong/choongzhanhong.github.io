## Itinerary

#### Armenia 4 Oct â€“ 6 Oct

- Areni
- 

#### Georgia 6 Oct â€“ 13 Oct

### Costs

Flights cost 1.6k for a multi-city trip.
Singapore to Armenia with one stop in Doha cost about 600,
and Georgia to Singapore with a stop in Doha cost 1000.
According to my friend who planned the trip, he snagged the tickets
when the prices dropped to 1000 **total**.

My fault for booking later than them, but oh well.

For the trip from Armenia to Georgia, though a train ride was on the table,
we decided on a flight, about 142 per pax.

- Flights: 1750

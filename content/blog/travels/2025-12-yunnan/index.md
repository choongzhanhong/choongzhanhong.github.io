Here are some photos from a family trip to China, in which we visited parts of Yunnan
(<ruby>云<rt>yún</rt>南<rt>nán</rt></ruby>). 

It wasn't a very adventurous trip, save for
me trying to get by with my poor mandarin skills, but the nature was quite breathtaking.
I'd sure like to revisit the other parts of China some other time.

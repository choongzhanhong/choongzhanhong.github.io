This is part of a multi-country trip I had. See also: [Georgia](../2025-10-georgia/).

I went with a friend and two others, four of us boys sharing one car.
To explore the sparse mountainous countries in the Caucasus region, a car
was definitely needed.

## Places Visited 

### Zvartnots

We spent our first night in Zvartnots technically, touching down at the airport
just past midnight and spending the first night at hotel Altunyan.

We were unaccustomed to the driving and missed a turn, and were thus rerouted through
the [Alley of Glory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rTnTqdx4ynGeSGVk7), which was quite a trial to drive through.

Bumpy and narrow roads, darkness in some parts, with an apt name to boot,
just the type of drive we needed at 1am after a series of flights.

Our hotel window faced south, so we had a nice view of Mount Ararat, which remained visible as we
drove down to Khor Virap, en route to Areni.

### Areni 

Our check-in date was on the 4th of October, which just so happened to be the day of the biggest wine 
festival in Armenia, located in Areni.

### Lake Sevan

### Garni, Geghard

### Yerevan

Finally, after a loop around parts of the country,

## Itinerary

### Costs

Flights cost 1.6k for a multi-city trip.
Singapore to Armenia with one stop in Doha cost about 600,
and Georgia to Singapore with a stop in Doha cost 1000.
According to my friend who planned the trip, he snagged the tickets
when the prices dropped to 1000 **total**.

My fault for booking later than them, but oh well.

For the trip from Armenia to Georgia, though a train ride was on the table,
we decided on a flight, about 142 per pax.

- Flights: 1750

This is part of a multi-country trip I had. 
We first visited [Armenia](../2025-10-armenia/) for a few days before 
spending the majority of the trip in Georgia.

Georgia is a nice little country tucked away in the Caucasus region.
Coming from Armenia, I noticed the country was noticeably more developed,
and was caught off-guard by the existence of McDonald's, H&M, and basically
other global brands.

It's very similar to Armenia in many ways, being the second country to adopt
Christianity after Armenia, and of course as members of the Soviet Union.
The region is mountainous, offering beautiful landscapes and cool weather.

## Tbilisi 

We spent some days in Tbilisi at the beginning and at the end of our Georgia trip.

## Stepantsminda (aka Kazbegi)

After the first day, we drove up north to Stepantsminda, which is a small mountain
town near the Russian border. This was something that I had been looking forward to,
because of the glacier hike we had planned at Gergeti.

The path we took is known as the 
[military road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Military_Road), which 
was used to connect Georgia and Russia, starting from Tbilisi on the Georgian end.
Along the way north, there were many sights that you could stop at to appreciate.

The town itself had the highest concentration of tourists seen thus far, mostly 
Chinese and Korean. We found ourselves in a nice little homestay, a short walk from 
the town

At the tail end of the trip, two of us had more days in Georgia. We opted for 
day trips, one day to the eastern sites of Georgia, another for the west.

For the most part, these day trips run by tour operators are typically watered down 
and funnel you to the same few spots that have their prices jacked up for tourists.
While I still appreciate that some of these spots were nice to visit, they're still 
better experienced at your own pace if you can rent a car instead.

## East Georgia 

### Sighnavi

## West Georgia 

The western side of Georgia was the more interesting of the two, although 
we didn't fully explore the west (such as the regions by the Black Sea).

### Vardzia

## Itinerary

At the end of this trip, I can conclude that the Caucasus region is absolutely
worth visiting if you like nature, and they are very welcoming people.
I'd certainly come back again, perhaps visit the other regions I had missed out.

### Costs

I've aggregated the costs in the [Armenia](../2025-10-armenia/) post (do give it
a read too!), but anyway expect Georgia to be slightly more expensive.

As of the trip, the exchange rate was 2 Georgian Lari (GEL) to 1 SGD. For funzies
we called it the Georgian Ringgit and one of our mates actually believed it was
called that.

### Notes

In Georgia, the main convenience store is Spar. The country uses GEL, but I believe 
they're trying to phase in the Euro in a bid for membership with the EU.

The Tbilisi metro is reliable and cheap, I highly recommend using it to get around.
While we did get caught in a train crowd once, it wasn't too unpleasant.
Of course, taking a taxi is also not expensive (compared to Singapore).

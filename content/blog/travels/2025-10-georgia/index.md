This is part of a multi-country trip I had. [Armenia](../2025-10-armenia/)

Georgia is a nice little country tucked away in the Caucasus region.
Coming from Armenia, I noticed the country was noticeably more developed,
and was caught off-guard by the existence of McDonald's, and then many other
brands one might find in a capitalist country.

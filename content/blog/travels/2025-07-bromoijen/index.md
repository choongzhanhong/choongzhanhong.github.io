Over the weekend, I went to Surabaya on the Indonesian island of Java
to explore the famous volcano spots Ijen and Bromo.

We were so lucky to be blessed with two days of no rain, and clear skies!
While my photos are clear, you simply had to be there to take in everything
with your own two eyes. Trust me.

I went with some friends, but made plenty more by going with Sotravel.
All 19 of us became fast friends during the trip, which only spanned three days!

## Ijen Caldera

The trail had us going up to the rim of Ijen caldera, followed by a descent into
the crater where we could observe blue flames (sulfur gas ignition) within
the active volcano.

It was a decent hike; consisting roughly 2 hours of continuously steep ascent.
Nothing technical, but just required you to keep moving.

Oh, and to see the blue fires, we had to be there before sunrise, while it's
still dark. So, we began the hike around 2am.

### Getting There

We left the hotel at **11pm** and drove about 2 hours to 
[Paltuding](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CitaF1pMmTgx4DxS7), where there were campsites,
rest areas with warm food and toilets, where you can rent gas masks and a headlamp.

### Trail

The trail begins at Paltuding, and is about 2 hours up
to the rim. It was a rather steep slope that continued for the majority
of the trail. Quite like an incline walk on the treadmill.

The weather at this point is quite cold, as Paltuding is about 1.8km above
sea level, and you trek about 500m (elevation gain) to the crater rim.

## Itinerary

### Nosleep

We had absolutely zero nights of proper sleep. Most days began early
in the wee morning in order to outrun dawn.

### Packing Notes

We were lucky not to have encountered any rain, but everyone who's gone
recommends **waterproof** raincoat/poncho/jackets.
Naturally, the weather will be cold (10-20Â°C) in both areas.

Bring shoes appropriate for trekking as you don't want to risk slipping
on Ijen on either descent (into crater, or back to base).

Bromo is easier, but there's lots of ash/sand on the ground.

### Costs

- Sotravel booking: $349
    - Includes hotel, transport, park entry, equipment rental, and guides.
- Flights: $231
- Food, purchases, tips: I spent roughly $70

**Total:** $650, give or take. Prices in SGD.

if you decide to pay for added services (quoted from the vendors):
- "Taxi" rides up/down Ijen: ~$100 USD up, ~$20 USD down.
- Pony rides across the Sea of Sand to Bromo: ~$20-30 USD.

It may be cheaper if you settle the itinerary yourself, 
probably saving up to $100.
I also feel like I could've gotten a better deal with the flights.
Nonetheless, it was well worth it for all the people I got to meet.

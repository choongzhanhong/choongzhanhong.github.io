### Co-curricular activities
-  I loved my time in the NUS Comedy Club. I would love to do stand-up and improv again.
Spent 3 years in the club's committee, organised some gigs.

- Some responsibilities in the NUS student's union, as a student ambassador,
and in the Comms and New Media society.

- Did some other things along the way, notably: DJ-ing,
seafaring, dodgeball, rollerskating, skateboarding,
band

Looking back, I'm surprised just how much time I had spent on
these activities on TOP of my academics! I &#9825; Uni life.

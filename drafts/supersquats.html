	<h2>Super Squats review<time datetime="2025-02-16">16 Feb 2025</time></h2>
	<p>
		TL;DR: started with 90kg squats and ended with 125kg x 15 clean reps.
	</p>
	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>
		From 16 Dec 2024 to 24 Jan 2025, I ran the 6-week programme Super Squats
		by Dr Randall Strossen. This was my 2nd time running super squats,
		this time round I decided to incorporate milk into my diet, albeit 
		still not GOMAD, but 2 liters a day. The previous run, I wasn't super committed,
		but I went from 60kg to 100kg for 20 rep squats.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had previously run several iterations of Jacked & Tan 2.0 to some success,
		and I was getting bored after my 3rd run of J&T back to back. I did try to
		lose some weight, but wasn't very successful. Consequently, I was still a little chubby
		but lethargic from lack of food. With the festive season coming up, I decided
		to regain some of my energy and double down on the eating, as well as cure my boredom
		with some good old fashioned hard work.
	</p>
	<p>
		My bio: 25 y/o male, 175cm, started at 80kg. I had been lifting since 2018,
		but admittedly spent the first few years spinning wheels. I have a background
		in sprinting, so I'm bottom-heavy; my legs are far stronger than my arms.
	</p>
	<h3>Programme Outline</h3>
	<p>
		I did a 3 day week (M, W, F) and did the bare minimum exercises each day (the abbreviated one),
		consisting of bench, squat, and rows, and crunches if I was in the mood (in that order).
		Aside from the 20 rep squats, it really wasn't very different from most
		other fullbody programmes, still centred around compound barbell exercises.
		Bench and Rows followed a simple progression: start with an appropriate weight,
		and if I hit max reps consistently on the sets, I increased the weight.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started with 90kg with 2.5kg increments each day.
	</p>
	<h3>Diet</h3>
	<p>
		My diet was about the same
	</p>
	<h3>Issues Faced</h3>
	<p>
		Because you focus on achieving 20-rep squats, you get a really good sense
		of where your points of failure lie. For me, it was usually one of the three:
		lower back, mental, or legs. In the early few workouts, I felt a lot of strain
		on my lower back, which indicated my posture wasn't fully upright, so I corrected it.
	</p>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>
		I gained 6kg to a total of . My legs and back feel much stronger and my posture has improved.
		I hit 125kg x 15 clean reps on my final workout, finishing with 5 half-ROM reps
		because I didn't feel my legs could keep up.

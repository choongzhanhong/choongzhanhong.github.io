		Outside of Marina Bay MRT, there once stood a barrier that forced commuters to take a detour to exit the
		train station to get to work. Naturally, no one actually did that, instead opting to hop over the
		barrier and forming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path" target="_blank">desire path</a> on the grass leading up to it.

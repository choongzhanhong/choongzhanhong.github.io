		Through the high school to university, I have always preferred handwriting my notes.
		Nothing quite beats the tactile feel of pen being put to paper, 
		and arguably, it <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-writing-by-hand-is-better-for-memory-and-learning/" target="_blank">
		boosts learning</a> in the process.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's a breakdown of some of my stationery.
	</p>
	<p>
		The MUJI pen is an all-timer when it comes to inexpensive, refillable, and simple, no-frills writing.
		I like my pens as fine as possible, so I appreciate the 0.38mm tip size. The ink comes out
		smoothly and are usually in brilliant shades (I simply enjoy the black and blue ones).
	</p>
	<p>
		There's only so far you can get with a ballpoint pen, however.
		Ballpoints glide smoothly on paper, which is a feature I realised I don't need when I started using nib pens.
		The resistance and scratchiness you get from a nib just scratched the itch for me.
		You could feel the whole texture of the paper through the pen as an extension of your hand,
		a feeling that isn't altogether removed when using a ballpoint, but largely diminished,
		especially on thicker ballpoint tip sizes (which may be why I prefer finer pens).
	</p>

		I first began by using dip pens, before I got myself a fountain pen. The Pilot Kakuno was a game-changer for me.
		It's cheap and simple, all with a smile on its face. I got one with a converter, which allowed me to
		refill my ink instead of using cartridges, in the name of the environment.
		I use Pelikan 4001 Brilliant Schwarz, and it's nowhere near running out.
		As far as value-for-money goes, a fountain pen, converter, and ink pot beats everything <em>by far</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for my mechanical pencil, I used to own a Pilot Rexgrip that lasted me all my early schooling days,
		but it recently broke irreparably. I took to the bookstore to look for a replacement.
		I didn't just get the same pencil, nor any one on sale. This was a rare opportunity for a fresh start.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		And finally, a toast to my pencil case, which has stuck with me for over a decade.
		I still recall purchasing this no-name case at my high school's bookstore,
		inscribing my name on its side with a permanent marker, 
		not knowing just how long it would stay by my side. Its zipper
		works more than fine, and the fabric, stains aside (my fault), perfectly pristine.

		Here's a simple question: given a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_flush_toilet" target="_blank">dual flush toilet</a>,
		which button would you press for the "small flush"?

	</p>
	<p>
		I posed this question to my followers on Instagram, and after a day, I received a unanimous vote for the "small button". Some even replied to my story,
		expressing their ___ at how obvious the choice should be. In the spirit of research, I told them to "just vote".
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, that makes sense. So <em>why is it that I sometimes reach for the wrong button</em>? It's funny on several ends:
		First, well, my household has dual flush toilets installed (practically universal in all Singaporean households).
		Secondly, I definitely use the toilet a healthy amount, which would be multiple times every single day for the past many years I've
		been on this good Earth. These all mean that I should, by now, have already developed the knowledge, let alone the muscle memory,
		to press the right button. I should mention I have been toilet trained since young and am in no manner, as one might put it, developmentally challenged.

		I am led to believe that I am subscribed to conflicting schools of thought, in particular of design, that create this 
	</p>
	<h3>Interaction Design</h3>
	<p>
		This is a physical application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law" target="_blank">Fitt's Law</a>, which
		states that the time taken to move to a target (say, a button) is dependent on the distance to the target and the width of the target.
		In essence, bigger buttons are easier to hit.
	</p>
	<p>
		The law manifests in interaction design all the time. Just looking at interfaces, there's a reason why the "BUY" button on an online store can take up
		a quarter of the page, while the "X" on an advertisement is not only tiny but also in one far-reaching corner,]
		you could even misclick it and click on the ad instead. These are both ways that designers ease user behaviour towards or against 
		a certain behaviour.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think the next step is to break down why toilet buttons are so taken for granted!

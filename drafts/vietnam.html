	<h2>Hanoi, Sa Pa, Fansipan 29 Jan to 4 Feb 2025<time datetime="2024-12-05">05 Dec 2024</time></h2>
	<p>
		Over the lunar new year holidays, I went to Vietnam for a week; with my family for the first 4 days, and solo the last 3 days.
		I'd like to take some time to brush the dust off my drafts folder and write a little reflection on the trip,
		along with a review of things that may be of use to interested readers. Buckle up, this may be a long one.

	<h3>Itinerary</h3>
	<p>
		I planned loosely around the main thing I wanted to do: Conquer mount Fansipan in Sa Pa. 
		Everything else was mostly planned impromptu. My eventual itinerary became:
		
		<ul>
		-- With family --
		<li>Day 1: Exploring Hanoi Old Quarters, night train to Sa Pa</li>
		<li>Day 2: Exploring Sa Pa Centre</li>
		<li>Day 3: Go up Fansipan, night train to Hanoi</li>
		<li>Day 4: Exploring Hanoi West Lake and Old Quarters</li>
		-- Solo --
		<li>Day 5: Exploring Ba Dinh area, Old Quarters</li>
		<li>Day 6: Day trip to Ninh Binh</li>
		<li>Day 7: Lunch with Hanoi friend before flight</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
		
	<p>
		Itinerary-wise, this was rather tight. A night train meant we had a whole day to explore the area, which was plenty of time,
		all the while saving on a night's worth of hotel fees. HOWEVER, it also meant we had no room to rest or refresh ourselves
		until our train, and also after getting off our train, as most check-ins are in the afternoon.
		
		This was a crucial mistake, as I had planned a train back to Hanoi right after my Fansipan hike, which meant I went a day
		without showering after my hike. Thankfully, the weather was frigid with strong winds, especially at the summit. I didn't stink and didn't sweat.
		I still should have planned this differently, as spiritually I felt stinky.

	<p>
		Since we arrived during the lunar new year, or Tết, many shops were closed on the first few days. It was a completely different Hanoi 
		when we first touched down versus the last few days (Tết celebrations ended on Monday, 3 Feb, and most businesses resumed then).
		I thought we would see a unique side of Vietnam with Tết celebrations, but we didn't encounter much. What we did see were loads of families
		dressed to the nines crowding the busy streets, and that was a sight to behold. Everybody looked so good.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Hanoi has several winterwear shops. It was a good first stop for us, instead of directly going to Sa Pa, as I desperately needed more coverage than had I
		packed. I wore three layers during the hike and it still wasn't enough to stave off the cold completely, because I'm so used to hot, tropical Singapore.

		I don't know if it was because of Tết or if uncles just have that much drip, but just about every uncle I saw was slaying the house down in their suits.
		Vietnam is known for some of its tailors, whose services are pretty fast and affordable. I hadn't planned to tailor a suit, but I feel I should have.
		All those uncles must have gotten their suits locally, and they were walking advertisements to the quality of suits in Hanoi to me.

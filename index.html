            <h1>Hi, I'm Zhan Hong.</h1>

            <p>I'm an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in <b>Communications and New Media</b> with a minor in <b>Computer Science</b>. </p>

            <p>I have a keen interest in design of all sorts. That includes UI/UX and graphic design, but also product, game, and web design.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I like to play sports, instruments, or video games. I also sometimes lift weights and do stand-up comedy. Please take a look around at my site and projects!</p>

            <p>
              I started out as an executive committee member of the NUS Comedy club, progressing into the
              vice-president, then the president. During my time in the NUS Comedy Club, I helped to
              elevate the club's offerings higher; We established connections with figureheads in the
              local comedy scene, including comedians like Fakkah Fuzz or Dr Jason Leong, as well as
              organisations supporting comedy like The Lemon Stand Comedy Club.
              <br>
              Altogether, we established an inclusive training ground for aspiring comedians in NUS to
              grow and learn. Our training sessions and events offer our members opportunities to hone
              their craft in front of a live crowd, with feedback from experts and experienced peers.

              As the director of NUSSU commIT's training cell, I managed the free workshops targeted at
              NUS students to impart technical skills, such as the Adobe suite, Excel, Python, and HTML
              (I adapted my earlier Bootstrap Bootcamp materials).
              <br>
              My responsibilities included managing my team of 15 trainers, together with one other
              partner director, we trained them on the required technical skills, teaching skills, and
              created workshop materials. We also handled administrative matters like booking of
              training venues and marketing our events.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
              The more fun stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm into lifting weights, and although I've read through a few books<label for="books">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="books"><small>

                Namely, Super Squats and Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 original/forever/beyond.

              </small> and forums/blogs (<a target="_blank" href="https://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/">this one's</a> pretty cool),
              I think I'm at the stage where I'm doing far less dedicated eating and dieting, due to having limited time. Still, it's a lifetime habit I hope to keep up.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also play dodgeball, mainly in NUS. I think it's a neat sport that should get more recognition. Throwing balls (and hitting people) is very cathartic. I host and teach dodgeball sessions in my hostel in NUS.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm also into coffee, the kind where I buy my own beans and brew it myself, yes. I also enjoy playing the guitar, drums, and singing, all at a very amateur level.
            </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
              I like teaching and learning stuff. I'm the kind of person who enjoys picking up random new hobbies and projects as well (<i>finishing</i> them, is another story).
            </p>

            <p>
              I like thinking about design, definitely.

                  This project was done as part of a course on user experience design, and involved an iterative design process.

                  I spearheaded and planned a one-day introductory workshop on creating a website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. During the event, they made their own website to store their portfolio and CV (much like this one!), and networked with each other as well.

                  I also shared my Adobe experience to contribute to our workshop on Adobe Illustrator. These workshops were done during my time in the NUS Communications and New Media (CNM) Society. The skills taught helped NUS students, including those in the CNM department to be equipped with skills relevant to the new media industry.

                  Part of my final project in a HTML/CSS/Javascript class. I created an interactive ball physics simulator.
                  For the actual project, I used Node.js to implement a dynamic web page where multiple users could play a "ping-pong" game using similar ball physics. Unfortunately, GitHub can only serve static pages so that is not shown.

                I review the courses/modules I took in National University of Singapore. <a target="_blank" href="https://nusdropouts.blogspot.com/">Link</a>

              <p>
                I also made a spreadsheet academic plan template, with CAP calculator. I made it for myself but it may be of use to you. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RPLs8ypVFA0et6TXn6qVLqu6sgye9BbLiKdt7GwVUHU/edit?usp=sharing">Get your copy here.</a>

              <h2>Confucius Said... <time datetime="2023-10-26">26.10.2023</time></h2>
              <p>
                I like this saying that goes:
                <blockquote>
                  "It takes two wipes (of the toilet paper) to know that you need three, but it
                  takes three wipes to know you only needed two."
                </blockquote>
                There's probably some variance in how this quote is said. I think this version is
                quite meaningful, though.
              </p>
              <p>
                To me, it's the corollary to the quote:
                <blockquote>
                  "Hindsight is 20/20."
                </blockquote>
                Where, yes, it's an admission that, with the benefit of hindsight, things may
                seem clearer or obvious. But, hindsight isn't something you have the benefit of having
                when you're in the middle of a situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, the choices you make are often informed by what you know at the given point. And there's merit in that. You'll wipe.

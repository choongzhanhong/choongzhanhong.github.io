  <p>I moved house in 2025, and decided it'd be a good time to throw away my old, piss-stained (my cat's, I swear!) single-sized mattress.
I thought this would be the perfect time to do a little research on what makes a good mattress,
and meaningfully replace my old mattress.</p>
<p>Just previously, I had been thinking of sleeping on a Futon-type thing to save a bit of floor space too.
While it's still tempting, I don't think I'd actually get used to folding it up daily.</p>
<p>I came across a YouTube video on my Twitter feed which I watched in full one weekend afternoon.
He gave quite some compelling arguments.</p>
<p>TL;DR, latex is the way, or memory foam if you have to. Absolutely avoid coils.</p>

<p>So, I set off in search of latex mattresses available in Singapore,
specifically seeing if I could find any of the Talalay kind.</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>In short, my search came up disappointing. Among the companies I searched,
<strong>none</strong>* had Talalay latex.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many salespeople did not even know
the difference. At one place where I inquired, the sales lady opened her
laptop to find that they were given a document with info on Dunlop vs Talalay,
which she had never needed to read before.</p>
<p>Even though Singapore is situated amongst sprawling rubber plantations in Southeast Asia,
few companies in the area, even some Thai and Malaysian ones, supply
Talalay latex.</p>
<p>Understandably, the process itself is more expensive, and I don't suppose
there's much demand in the area.</p>
<p>The US stores don't ship to Singapore. If you really wanted to, you could ship them yourself
through a forwarding service. Likewise with the Vitalalay factories in Europe.
This would probably be the option that guarantees the most reliable results.</p>
<p><em>*There were some places selling Talalay Latex toppers, or their mattresses
included a thin layer of Talalay Latex. See below.</em></p>
<h3>Decent local brands if you're okay with Dunlop</h3>

<p>A few brands I shortlisted in my find were decent, but mostly have Dunlop latex.
If you don't really find the difference between Talalay and Dunlop to be that big
of a deal, you could just buy one of these here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heveya, while expensive, is B Corp certified and is fully transparent
about their mattress makeup, which is 100% Dunlop latex, no frills.
I liked their presentation, and they get my vote for their commitment to sustainability,
transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sofzsleep is the budget option which also offers 100% Dunlop latex mattresses.
They offer many different mattresses, but I can't really tell the difference between
any of them. Maybe it's the thickness? Nonetheless, you can check them out in-store at
the Mattress Boutique to find out more. Value for money option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getha's mattresses are Dunlop based on their website's info, but they also sell
Talalay pillows, and some of their mattresses reportedly have a layer of Talalay
in-between. Mid-ranged prices here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dunlopillo, which is probably an industry leader, has this &quot;Talasilver wave&quot;
mattress layer which I assume is based on Talalay. These make up the comfort layer
of some of their products, and the remaining layers are foam or I assume Dunlop latex.
They also sell Talalay latex toppers, in case you only need the topmost/comfort
layer to be Talalay, this is a reliable option too, being an established name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Woosa gets a special shoutout in this section. Their mattresses do have latex
on the top layers, otherwise they're filled with foam and some coils.
They also claim to use a layer of Talalay, although from what I see it's really thin.
I know, because they present their cross-sections in the stores, which is absolutely what
every mattress brand should do for full transparency.
This brand gets my vote because I lay on their mattresses in-store and they were
extremely soft and comfortable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Conclusion</h3>
<p>I was hell-bent on getting a Talalay mattress, if not just to compare
it to Dunlop and see what the fuss is about. In the name of science!</p>
<p>In the end, I looked to Taobao, which is probably the best place to look.
I didn't want to concede just yet, and thought maybe I could
actually DIY something inexpensive.</p>
<p>Another poster on the Mattress Underground shared the same difficulty
finding Talalay latex mattresses in Singapore, and even the ones
on Taobao couldn't be truly verified.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they made the purchase a year ago, and are reportedly satisfied
with the product. They even supplied the name of the store they bought from,
which saved me a bit of comparing around.</p>
<p>The subsequent sections deal with my experience after receiving the mattress.</p>

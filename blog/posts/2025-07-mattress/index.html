  <p>I moved house in 2025, and decided it'd be a good time to throw away my old, piss-stained (my cat's, I swear!) single-sized mattress.
I thought this would be the perfect time to do a little research on what makes a good mattress,
and meaningfully replace my old mattress.</p>
<p>Just previously, I had been thinking of sleeping on a futon-type thing to save a bit of floor space too.
While it's still tempting, I don't think I'd actually get used to folding it up daily.</p>
<p>I came across a YouTube video on my Twitter feed which I watched in full one weekend afternoon.
He gave some compelling arguments.</p>
<p>TL;DR, Get a latex mattress, or memory foam if you have to. Absolutely avoid coils.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLVmNjaxBLA?si=EK8qZJi9DJtKkDY0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Another TL;DR:
There are two main types of latex mattresses based on the chemical process used to make them.
The typical one is Dunlop, with Talalay latex being a more complicated and thus expensive process.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talalay_process">Talalay process</a> confers some
properties to the latex that may be preferred: most say softer, more breathable.
A lot of mattress store websites have an article on the difference<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>In short, my search came up disappointing. Among the companies I searched,
<strong>none</strong>* had Talalay latex.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many salespeople did not even know
the difference. At one place where I inquired, the sales lady opened her
laptop to find that they were given a document with info on Dunlop vs Talalay,
which she had never needed to read before.</p>
<p>Even though Singapore is situated amongst sprawling rubber plantations in Southeast Asia,
I could not find companies in the area that supplied Talalay latex, not even in Thailand
or Malaysia.</p>
<p>Understandably, the process itself is more expensive, and I don't suppose
there's much demand in the area.</p>
<p>The US stores don't ship to Singapore. If you really wanted to, you could ship them yourself
through a forwarding service. Likewise with the Vitalalay factories in Europe.
This would probably be the option that guarantees the most reliable results.</p>
<p>* There were some places selling Talalay Latex toppers, or their mattresses
included a thin layer of Talalay Latex. See below.</p>
<h3>Decent local brands if you're okay with Dunlop</h3>

<p>A few brands I shortlisted in my find were decent, but mostly have Dunlop latex.
If you don't really find the difference between Talalay and Dunlop to be that big
of a deal, you could just buy one of these here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.heveya.sg/">Heveya</a>, while expensive, is B Corp certified and is fully transparent
about their mattress makeup, which is 100% Dunlop latex, no frills.
I liked their presentation, and they get my vote for their commitment to sustainability,
transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sofzsleep.net/">Sofzsleep</a> is the budget option which also offers 100% Dunlop latex mattresses.
They offer many different mattresses, but I can't really tell the difference between
any of them. Maybe it's the thickness? Nonetheless, you can check them out in-store at
the Mattress Boutique to find out more. Value for money option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://getha.com.sg">Getha's</a> mattresses are Dunlop based on their website's info, but they also sell
Talalay pillows, and some of their mattresses reportedly have a layer of Talalay
in-between. Mid-ranged prices here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dunlopillo.com.sg/">Dunlopillo</a>, which is probably an industry leader, has this &quot;Talasilver wave&quot;
mattress layer which I assume is based on Talalay. These make up the comfort layer
of some of their products, and the remaining layers are foam or I assume Dunlop latex.
They also sell Talalay latex toppers, in case you only need the topmost/comfort
layer to be Talalay, this is a reliable option too, being an established name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://woosasleep.co">Woosa</a> gets a special shoutout in this section. Their mattresses do have latex
on the top layers, otherwise they're filled with foam and some coils.
They also claim to use a layer of Talalay, although from what I see it's really thin.
I know, because they present their cross-sections in the stores, which is absolutely what
every mattress brand should do for full transparency.
This brand gets my vote because I laid on their mattresses in-store and they were
extremely soft and comfortable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Conclusion</h3>
<p>I was hell-bent on getting a Talalay mattress,
if only just to see what the fuss is about. In the name of science!</p>
<p>In the end, I looked to Taobao, which is probably the best place to look.
I didn't want to concede just yet, and thought maybe I could
actually DIY something inexpensive.</p>
<p>Another poster on the Mattress Underground shared the same difficulty
finding Talalay latex mattresses in Singapore, and even the ones
on Taobao couldn't be truly verified.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they made the purchase a year ago, and are reportedly satisfied
with the product. They even supplied the name of the store they bought from,
which saved me a bit of comparing around.</p>
<p>The subsequent sections deal with my experience after receiving the mattress.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Doing it Myself</h2>
<h3>Ordering the parts</h3>
<p>I bought a total of three mattress layers off Taobao, all in queen size (150 by 200cm).</p>
<p>The Talalay layer, intended for the topmost layer<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> of the mattress,
was 10cm thick and cost about ￥6800.
Supposedly, this was imported from Vitalalay.</p>
<p>The other two layers, I bought Dunlop layers at different &quot;deflection&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.
Each was 7.5cm thick, and I got 85D and 95D at ￥1330 and ￥1700 respectively.</p>
<p>Total costs chalked up to about ￥8200, or S$1465, or US$1146, the majority of which
was the price of the Talalay layer. Oh, and this price was not inclusive of
shipping fees and import taxes, which were another few hundred.</p>
<p>I also got a mattress cover/protector and some bedsheets. There are some considerations here as well.
Without going into too much research, I got an unquilted cover<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> that claimed to be waterproof
(in case my cat pees on my bed again), and I got HOOGA Cara cotton sateen bedsheets<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p>The mattresses in their entirety arrived about a month after I had initially ordered.
With the mattresses shipped, it was time to start assembling the layers.</p>
<p>For the bedframe, I got a queen-sized replica of the <a href="https://ikeamuseum.com/en/explore/product-stories/kromvik-bed-1982/">KROMVIK</a>,
which fit the mattress height just nicely. Taobao truly is amazing.</p>
<p>Overall, it didn't take very long, but the mattresses were heavy, or rather unwieldy.
I think I also received extra pillows from the store, which is nice.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>Here's how it looked like in the end, before I wrapped it up with the covers.
All the mattress layers arrived with their own covers.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/img/yAlaGmbhKg-600.avif 600w, /img/yAlaGmbhKg-900.avif 900w, /img/yAlaGmbhKg-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/yAlaGmbhKg-600.webp 600w, /img/yAlaGmbhKg-900.webp 900w, /img/yAlaGmbhKg-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"><img alt="Bed" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/yAlaGmbhKg-600.jpeg" width="1200" height="901" srcset="/img/yAlaGmbhKg-600.jpeg 600w, /img/yAlaGmbhKg-900.jpeg 900w, /img/yAlaGmbhKg-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"></picture></p>
<p>I was eager to start sleeping on this bed already.
These past few months, I had been sleeping on a hard mattress on the floor as a
temporary arrangement, so I had something to compare against.</p>
<p>My first night, I was pleased with the amount of space I had. I don't know how
I slept on a single bed before, I must've always had a limb or two jutting out at any given time.</p>
<p>First, I noticed that it's soft, but not bouncy. If I jumped on it, I wouldn't fly,
I'd just sink into it.</p>
<p>It was a pain to align the layers flush due to their heftiness.
I decided it was not worth the effort and zipped it all up in a cover, with much effort.</p>

<p>The latex mattress fit the curves of my body well. As a side-sleeper, I require more support
as the body tends can bend laterally, in more extreme ways than sleeping on the back.
Check out <a href="https://spinehealth.org/article/sleeping-and-the-spine/">this article</a> on recommended support.</p>
<p>On that note, pillow size also matters in supporting your head in the various positions.</p>
<p>Not to brag, but harder mattresses were unable to support my musculature, especially
my thighs, which are larger and harder than average. They were always a source of discomfort
whenever I decided to sleep in an unorthodox position (on the stomach), in which I lay with my
thighs facing down instead of facing up.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/img/QiTsUlMAEv-600.avif 600w, /img/QiTsUlMAEv-900.avif 900w, /img/QiTsUlMAEv-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/QiTsUlMAEv-600.webp 600w, /img/QiTsUlMAEv-900.webp 900w, /img/QiTsUlMAEv-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"><img alt="A bed" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/QiTsUlMAEv-600.jpeg" width="1200" height="1598" srcset="/img/QiTsUlMAEv-600.jpeg 600w, /img/QiTsUlMAEv-900.jpeg 900w, /img/QiTsUlMAEv-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"></picture></p>
<p>Overall, you can never really tell whether a mattress is good or not, as it's something
you really only know after years of sleeping on it. Still, it's a step above what I've been sleeping on,
and I think I got more than my money's worth, so I'm pleased!</p>

<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>The layers of a mattress include the comfort layer, which is the topmost, softest one,
and the support layer, which is firmer at the base. In-between, you may find a transition layer.
In general, the mattress goes from soft to firm as you go down. <a href="https://sleepopolis.com/guides/mattress-layers-guide/">Some more information</a> <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>When discussing mattress firmness, a measurement called
<a href="https://sleeponlatex.com/blog/what-is-ild">Indentation Load Deflection</a>
or ILD is used. Each store's deflection can only really by compared against itself,
so I'm guessing 85D is less firm than 95D. <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn4" class="footnote-item"><p>I haven't done much research on the differences, but from
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/16m3trw/diy_mattress_quilted_versus_unquilted_cover/">what I gather</a>,
the differences include softness and temperature circulation. Quilted covers may be firmer,
less stretchy, but offer better breathability. <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn5" class="footnote-item"><p>A friend recommended Tencel/Lyocell sheets, and I was considering linen or bamboo, but I decided

  <p>This is part of a multi-country trip I had. See also: <a href="../2025-10-georgia/">Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>I went with a friend and two others, four of us boys sharing one car.
To explore the sparse mountainous countries in the Caucasus region, a car
was definitely needed.</p>

<h2>Zvartnots</h2>
<p>We spent our first night in Zvartnots technically, touching down at the airport
just past midnight and spending the first night at hotel Altunyan.</p>
<p>We were unaccustomed to the driving and missed a turn, and were thus rerouted through
the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rTnTqdx4ynGeSGVk7">Alley of Glory</a>, which was quite a trial to drive through.</p>
<p>Bumpy and narrow roads, darkness in some parts, with an apt name to boot,
just the type of drive we needed at 1am after a series of flights.</p>
<p>Our hotel window faced south, so we had a nice view of Mount Ararat, which remained visible as we
drove down to Khor Virap, en route to Areni.</p>
<h2>Areni</h2>
<p>Our check-in date was on the 4th of October, which just so happened to be the day of the biggest wine
festival in Armenia, located in Areni.</p>
<p>Because we booked a shack on top of Noravank Gorge, <a href="https://www.ecolur.org/en/news/biodiversity/15945/">Sareni</a>,
the only way up was through a mountain road which was closed off on this very day!</p>
<p>We contacted the folks and the manager, Vardges, led us to his restaurant, where we parked our car
and took his jeep up another off-road way up to Sareni.</p>
<h3>Arpa Protected Landscape</h3>
<p>Lord, it was beautiful. We could just leave the hut and trek around, m</p>
<p>Probably the best spot for scenic pisses.</p>
<h2>Lake Sevan</h2>
<h2>Garni, Geghard</h2>
<p>We stayed for a night at Garni, in another &quot;hidden garden&quot;.</p>
<p>We told the owner we were headed for Geghard monastery, and he gave us a chef's kiss
and made the sign of the cross, so you know UNESCO got something good in store for you.
Anyway, we grew weary of the monasteries after a while, and arrived too early
(or maybe it was closed), so we enjoyed the entrance and left.</p>
<h2>Yerevan</h2>
<p>Finally, after a loop around parts of the country, our last stop was Yerevan.</p>
<p>Before heading for the airport, we had a few hours to kill, and frankly
cut it too close, making it to check-in in the last minute.</p>
<p>In fact, too much time was lost trying to park. I learned my lesson the hard way:
never try to drive or park in the city, least of all in a historical European city where
the infrastructure was never meant for such density.</p>
<p>At one point, we got stuck in a narrow two-way alley, and a local got in our
car to help us navigate the gridlock. Talk about hospitality!</p>

<h2>Itinerary</h2>
<p>We basically went to Areni, did a loop up to Lake Sevan without staying a night there,
and stayed again in Garni before returning to Yerevan.</p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>Armenia is slightly cheaper than Georgia, but also slightly less developed.
Food-wise, we ate a lot, which was typically SGD 10-20 per meal.</p>
<h4>Totals</h4>
<p>Flights cost 1.6k for a multi-city trip.
Singapore to Armenia with one stop in Doha cost about 600,
and Georgia to Singapore with a stop in Doha cost 1000.</p>
<p>According to my friend who planned the trip, he snagged the tickets
when the prices dropped to 1180 <strong>total</strong> (likely during the Israel-Iran exchanges).
My fault for booking later than them, but oh well.</p>
<p>Rounded up to 2-3 significant figures, prices in SGD</p>
<ul>
<li>Flights: $1750</li>
<li>Accomodations: $300</li>
<li>Transport: $320</li>
<li>Food: $275</li>
<li>Attractions: $88</li>
<li>Miscellaneous: $39</li>
</ul>

<h3>Co-curricular activities</h3>
<ul>

<p>I loved my time in the NUS Comedy Club. I would love to do stand-up and improv again.
Spent 3 years in the club's committee, organised some gigs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some responsibilities in the NUS student's union, as a student ambassador,
and in the Comms and New Media society.</p>

<p>Did some other things along the way, notably: DJ-ing,
seafaring, dodgeball, rollerskating, skateboarding,
band</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking back, I'm surprised just how much time I had spent on
these activities on TOP of my academics! I ♡ Uni life.</p>

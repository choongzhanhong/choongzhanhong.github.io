            Also, I know it isn't obvious, but I was in the gifted education programme (GEP)
            in Henry Park Primary School! (This isn't really a flex I just thought it's a fun fact.
            Damn I really peaked in primary school.)
        </p>
        <h3>Clubs</h3>
        <p>
            I loved my time in the NUS Comedy Club. I would love to do stand-up and improv again.
            Spent 3 years in the club's committee, organised some gigs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Did some other things along the way. A stint in the student's union, and my department's student society.
